## About the DataHighway Parachain Crowdloan for the Tanganika Network?

To launch the Tanganika Network on Kusama we need help to bootstrap it. The project must secure enough funds to cover the cost of renting ("leasing") a parachain slot on the network. To meet this objective, the DataHighway team will run a crowdloan campaign on behalf of the network. For the Tanganika crowdloan, individuals agree to lock up a portion of their KSM in exchange for the DHX native network token. These tokens are locked from the point of participation until the slot is successfully won, and then through the entirety of the lease period (48 Weeks). A pool of **300,000 (300k) DHX** tokens representing **1%** of the DataHighway Treasury's Unlocked Reserves comprising 30,000,000 DHX tokens, which equates to **0.3%** of the DataHighway's network's genesis total supply will be distributed to crowdloan participants as a reward (proportionate to their share of the overall KSMs contributed to the crowdloan) throughout the lease period.
The DHX tokens from the DataHighway's standalone chain which will stop operating, shall be bridged to the Tanganika parathread/parachain network on the Kusama.

## How to Contribute to the DataHighway Parachain Crowdloan for the Tanganika Network?

Please follow the steps in the **["Participating in a crowdloan"](https://kusama.network/auctions/)** section at https://kusama.network/auctions/ to contribute to the DataHighway Parachain Crowdloan for the Tanganika Network (Kusama Parachain Slot Campaign) natively on Kusama using Polkadot.js.

Tanganika Network intends to begin bidding to secure its first Kusama parachain during the next batch of [slot auctions](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-auction). Those that contribute to the [crowdloan](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-crowdloans) and contribute KSM to support the bid by the Tanganika Network will be rewarded with DHX native network tokens from the DataHighway Treasury's Unlocked Reserves.

The Kusama parachain auction timetable may be found [here](https://kusama.network/parachains/#contribute).

## Timing

### Crowdloan Start Date

If a crowdloan approach is used then **Kusama's 31st Auction** shown in the Kusama parachain auction timetame [here](https://kusama.network/parachains/#contribute) will be targeted.

### Lease Duration

We wish to use the crowdloan to secure a slot as a Kusama parachain for the maximum duration of 48 weeks.

### Token Lock Period

KSM tokens contributed to the crowdloan will be locked from the time they are contributed until the end of the parachain lease.

## Rewards

### Token Reward Pool

**300,000 (300k) DHX** tokens (**0.3%** of the DataHighway's genesis token supply).

### Contributor Rewards

Distributed as a % of your contribution to the Tanganika Network pool (your KSM Contribution to Tanganika Network / Total KSM Contributed to Tanganika Network) * **300k DHX** tokens. If your % contribution to Tanganika Network results in a fraction of DHX tokens then the corresponding DHX reward will be rounded down to the nearest whole number in DHX.

### Reward Distributions

**30%** of the total reward pool (**90,000 (90k) DHX** tokens) will be distributed within a reasonable timeframe upon successful launch and transfers being enabled. The remaining **70%** of the reward pool (**210k** DHX tokens) will vest over the slot lease duration (48 weeks).

## Participation Requirements

### Tokens Needed

KSM. If you do not yet have KSM, you will need to purchase some tokens in order to participate. If you already have KSM, ensure that it is located in a non-custodial wallet like Polkadot.js, and does not have any staking or democracy holds.

You need KSM stored in a non-custodial (non-exchange) address to participate using Polkadot.js, or through a partner exchange where applicable (to be announced).

### Wallets

Your unlocked, unbonded KSM must be connected to the Polkadot.js extension. This step is not necessary if you participate through a partner exchange.

## What is the Tanganika Network?

Tanganika Network will be a Kusama Parachain and the DataHighway's parachain canary network.

DHX is Tanganika's native token that was migrated from the DataHighway standalone chain at **1:1**.

An exception was made for accounts that had an account balance of less than the existential deposit of 0.001 DHX on the standalone chain. It was necessary to increase their account balance to be 0.001 DHX in the genesis of the parachain as explained [here](https://github.com/DataHighway-DHX/open-polkadot-js-library/blob/main/subscan/convert.js#L31)

The Tanganika Network was named after the second largest of the lakes in eastern Africa.

### Future Steps

The Kusama parachain should be shown in green with a "verified id" under the list of parathreads in Polkadot.js Apps

## What is the Parachain Testnet of Tanganika Network?

The [Spreehafen Parachain Testnet on Rococo](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://spreehafen.datahighway.com#/explorer). Rococo uses ROC tokens.

### Historic Steps

* Spreehafen code was written using the Substrate Parachain Template and by following the Substrate Cumulus Workshop
* DataHighway standalone chain pallet code was migrated to the parachain code branch
* DataHighway created a new [DataHighway-Parachain](https://github.com/DataHighway-DHX/DataHighway-Parachain) repository and migrated the parachain code branch
* ROC tokens received from the [Rococo faucet](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#rococo-faucet:matrix.org) and paraID 2116 registered.
* Startup of 2x ChaChaCha and 2x Rococo Validators and the 2x related Collators that were updated with code from ‘ilya/parachain-update' branch in an attempt to run Spreehafen parachain so the parachain connects to the relay chain and were ready for submission to ChaChaCha and Rococo
* Submitted our Collator Wasm and Genesis and were Onboarded as a Parathread and then as a Parachain on Rococo in Polkadot.js Apps 

## What is Tanganika Network's DHX Token

DHX token is the key to participating in the IoT-related DAO, Inter-Chain Data Market, the LPWAN Roaming Hub, and associated cross-chain DApps.

DHX token is the native token of Tanganika Network.

### Token Utility

* DAO Governance - To participating in DHX Mining you must be an active stakeholder and participate in community governance. For details, see the [10:1 Rule](https://dev.datahighway.com/docs/whitepapers/shortpaper#the-101-rule) in the DataHighway Shortpaper.
* Collator Rewards
* Cross-Chain DApps
* Cross-Chain Payments
* Inter-Chain Data Market
* LPWAN Roaming Hub

### Distribution

The following is the proportion of the total supply of DHX that will be distributed as rewards to Crowdloan Contributors:

* Crowdloan Contributors will be distributed **300,000 (300k) DHX** tokens (**0.3%** of the DataHighway's genesis token supply), which represents 1% of the 30,000,000 DHX in the DHX DAO Unlocked Reserves (Treasury endowment for DHX Mining Rewards). The DHX DAO Unlocked Reserves comprises 30% of the DataHighway's total supply of 100,000,000 DHX.

DHX Mining Power (mPower) Rewards equivalent to a 40% mPower boost (based on 24 month period) shall apply to tokens that are contributed to the crowdloan.

Note: In the crowdloan, those that lock their tokens to help the Tanganika Network secure a parachain slot will need to lock them for up to 48 weeks in a Kusama parachain crowdloan to get DHX tokens in return.

Depending on the vesting period mentioned in the Reward Distributions section, they could bond the DHX tokens they claim from DHX Mining when the tokens are distributed to them.

The tokens they lock during the crowdloan period will still earn them an mPower boost to increase their DHX Mining rewards.

### Mining

See the [DataHighway Shortpaper](https://dev.datahighway.com/docs/whitepapers/shortpaper).

Note: The minimum amount of mPower and bonded DHX that is required to mine DHX tokens through DHX Mining increases every 3 months.

Secure DHX Mining may be achieved using M2 Pro hardware.

The different forms of DHX Mining that will be available are mentioned in the [DataHighway Whitepaper](https://dev.datahighway.com/docs/whitepapers/whitepaper) (i.e. hardware mining using an M2 Pro, token mining by locking DataHighway's authorized value added tokens like MXC, E-IOTA, Polkadot, Filecoin, Huobi BTC).

### How to get DHX tokens

It may be possible to get DHX tokens through the following means:

* Collating (running a Parachain Collator)
* DHX Mining (with funding from DAO Unlocked Reserves)
  * DataHighway's authorized value added tokens supported include: MXC, E-IOTA, Polkadot, Filecoin, Huobi BTC
* Crowdloan Contribution
* Market Exchange

### Technology

Tanganika Network as a IoT layer for Web 3.0 metaverse developers.

DataHighway will be a Polkadot parachain where developers may invoke and interact with IoT-related smart contracts on other Polkadot parachains.

### Composability

Tanganika Network is built on Substrate to achieve cross-chain interoperability and composability in the Polkadot ecosystem.

### Applications & Use Cases

* Cross-Chain IoT DApps
* Cross-Chain DeFi (Liquidity Mining)
* Cross-Chain IoT Identity Layer
* Trustless IoT Data Exchange

## Participate

### Miners

#### How to be a DHX Miner?

[DHX Mining Tutorial](https://www.mxc.org/mxcdatadash)

#### Why Miners?

Secure hardware miners are the backbone of the Tanganika Network. Their health through being online and sufficient bandwidth is critical to the network and necessary for rewards.

#### Miner Node Environment

* Solo Mining
* Cooperative Mining Pools

#### Lending Protocol

In DataHighway's token economics model, miners require some DHX tokens to be bonded. In future DHX token holders may participate in liquidity mining by lending their DHX tokens to create an interest rates market.

### Collator Nodes

#### How to run a Collator Node?

[Collator Node Tutorial](https://dev.datahighway.com/docs/tutorials/tutorials-nodes-collators-setup)

#### Why Collator Nodes?

Collator nodes provide security and network availability through block production and finalisation to the Tanganika Network and should remain online. They also rotate keys at each block, process transactions and produce new parachain block candidates. This process involves re-encryption, verification, acceptance and publication of candidate blocks.
